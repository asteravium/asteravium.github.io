        <h1>I see you want to learn about the inner workings of Sofia's singular (but artistic) brain cell.</h1>
        <p>This, my friends, is your lucky day. You will either walk away inspired or just be bewildered as to how Sofia has managed to survive this long.</p>
        <p>Sofia grew up in Queens, New York and has been making art for about 14 years. It's literally her entire life. She was THAT art kid in middle school. She decided that she liked being the Art Kid so much that she decided to go to LaGuardia High School as an art major.</p>
        <p>At LaGuardia, Sofia decided that art was becoming more than just a hobby and began reasearching the wide, wide world of artistic careers. With the looming threat of the existence of the starving artist, Sofia's lonely brain cell couldn't decide what to do. At first it was storyboarding. Next, it was animation. After that came illustration and painting. After running through essentially every possibility known to man, the brain cell settled on biomedical illustration. Sofia had always loved the life sciences and challenging her artistic technique.</p>
        <p>Right now, Sofia wants to become a certified medical illustrator, but also wants to focus more on zoological illustration. She also wants to do some freelance painting on the side (go check out her Etsy shop!). Of course, these goals are probably going to change every few months or so, but we'll just have to wait and see!</p>
